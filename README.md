# gundataUS

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze both US census data and FBI gun data NCIS files found on Kaggle to uncover some key facts about guns in America. These results will
then be presented throughs plots and short paragraphs. 
## The Different Steps
### Gather and clean
The first part of the project is to gather and clean both datasets. Some of the key steps include converting a file to '.csv' format,  dropping rows and transposing DataFrames.
### Explore 
In this stage the dataset will be explored using simple computations and rudimentary maths. The main questions that will be answered are the following: 
* What is the overall trend in gun registrations in America? 
* Which states have experienced the highest growth in gun per capita?
* Is there a correlation between gun registrations and ethnicity in the states which have a high gun per capita?
